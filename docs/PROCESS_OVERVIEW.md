## Page 1: Document (Data Upload)

**Purpose:** Upload all available input from the company - both publicly available information and materials provided directly by the client.

**Page:** Document

### What to Upload

This is the first page where you provide all source data available:

| Source Type | Examples | Supported Formats |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Documents** | SOPs, Process manuals, Training materials | PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPTX, XLSX |
| **Website URLs** | Company website, Knowledge base, Public pages | URL references |
| **Internal Materials** | System documentation, Screenshots | PDF, Images |
| **Organizational Info** | Org charts, Role descriptions | PDF, DOCX |
| **Any Available Data** | Client-provided materials, Public information | All supported formats |

### Actions

1. Create a new project with client details
2. Navigate to the **Document** page
3. Upload all available sources of data:
   - Documents provided by the company
   - URLs for company websites
   - Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
   - Process flowcharts and diagrams
   - Any publicly available information
   - Any other materials at your disposal

### Output

- Documents are parsed, chunked, and vectorized
- Content is stored in the project's knowledge base
- Document summaries are generated for analysis

---

## Page 2: Interview (Agent Analysis)

**Purpose:** Agents analyze the uploaded source information and create a script to be used for the interview with the customer.

**Page:** Interview

### What Happens

The Interview page triggers agents to perform analysis and generate the interview script:

**Phase 1 - Document Ingestion:**
- All uploaded documents and sources are processed
- Content is analyzed for process patterns
- Information is prepared for hypothesis generation

**Phase 2 - Hypothesis Generation:**
- AI analyzes document content for operational inefficiencies
- Identifies suspected automation opportunities
- Generates confidence-scored hypotheses about:
  - "Dull" tasks (repetitive, boring work)
  - "Dirty" tasks (data manipulation, cleanup)
  - "Dangerous" tasks (error-prone, high-risk)

**Phase 3 - Interview Script Creation:**
- AI generates role-specific interview questions
- Questions are designed to validate hypotheses
- Follow-up questions are prepared for deeper exploration

### Actions

1. Navigate to the **Interview** page
2. Click **Start Analysis**
3. Wait for agents to complete the analysis
4. Review generated hypotheses and script creation progress

### Output

- List of hypotheses with confidence scores
- Identified areas of potential inefficiency
- Interview script generated for customer interview

---

## Page 3: Interview Script

**Purpose:** Provide the script to be used for the interview with the customer.

**Page:** Interview Script

### What It Contains

The Interview Script page displays the complete script generated by agents:

### Script Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Introduction** | How to open the interview |
| **Role-Specific Questions** | Targeted questions based on interviewee role |
| **Hypothesis Validation** | Questions to confirm or deny suspected inefficiencies |
| **Process Exploration** | Open-ended questions about daily work |
| **Follow-up Prompts** | Probing questions for deeper insights |
| **Closing** | How to wrap up the interview |

### Actions

1. Navigate to the **Interview Script** page
2. Review the generated interview script
3. Download or copy the script for use
4. Identify appropriate interviewees based on suggested roles
5. Schedule and conduct interviews with the customer

### Output

- Complete interview script in structured format
- Role recommendations for interviewees
- Questions mapped to hypotheses

## Human Breakpoint: Conduct the Interview with Customer

**After viewing the Interview Script (Page 3), the consultant conducts real interviews with the customer before proceeding to Results (Page 4).**

### Interview Guidelines

**Preparation:**
- Download the generated script from the Interview Script page
- Schedule 30-60 minute sessions with the customer
- Prepare note-taking or recording tools

**During the Interview:**
- Follow the script structure
- Use follow-up questions when discovering insights
- Document specific examples and time estimates
- Note any process variations or workarounds

**Key Areas to Explore:**
- How work is **actually** done vs. documented
- Pain points and frustrations
- Unofficial workarounds
- Time spent on tasks
- Bottlenecks and delays

### Creating the Interview Results

Document interview results in a structured format to upload on the Results page:

```
Interview Transcript
====================

Participant: [Role/Title]
Date: [Date]
Department: [Department]

Q: [Question from script]
A: [Interviewee's response]

Key Observations:
- [Notable insight 1]
- [Notable insight 2]
- [Time estimates mentioned]
- [Workarounds discovered]
```

---

## Page 4: Results

**Purpose:** Add extra documents (interview results) that agents use to create the report to be sent to the customer.

**Page:** Results

### What to Provide

Upload the interview results and any additional documents:
- Interview transcripts with responses to script questions
- Key observations and insights from interviews
- Specific examples mentioned by interviewees
- Time estimates and pain points discovered
- Any additional documents obtained during interviews

### What Happens

After uploading interview results, agents analyze the data and create the report:

**Phase 4 - Gap Analysis:**
- AI compares documented SOPs with interview findings
- Identifies discrepancies between documentation and reality
- Classifies gaps by automation potential

**Phase 5 - Solution Architecture:**
- AI maps gaps to potential solutions
- Generates technology recommendations
- Calculates ROI estimates
- Creates prioritized implementation roadmap

**Phase 6 - Report Generation:**
- AI compiles all analysis into a professional report
- Creates executive summary and recommendations

### Actions

1. Navigate to the **Results** page
2. Upload interview results documents (transcripts, notes, etc.)
3. Add any additional documents from the interview
4. Agents will process the data and create the report
5. Wait for report generation to complete

### Output

- **Gap Analysis:** Documented vs. actual process differences
- **Solution Recommendations:** Technology and approach suggestions
- **ROI Estimates:** Projected time and cost savings
- Report created by agents for customer delivery
