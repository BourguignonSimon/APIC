## Step 1: Document

**Purpose:** Collect and upload all available company information from public sources or provided by the client.

**Tab:** 1. Document

### What to Upload

At this first step, provide all input available from the company - both publicly available and materials provided directly by the client:

| Source Type | Examples | Supported Formats |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Documents** | SOPs, Process manuals, Training materials | PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPTX, XLSX |
| **Website Content** | Company website pages, Knowledge base articles | URL references (paste content) |
| **Public Information** | Annual reports, Press releases, Marketing materials | PDF, DOCX, TXT |
| **Internal Systems** | System documentation, Screenshots | PDF, Images |
| **Organizational Info** | Org charts, Role descriptions | PDF, DOCX |

### Actions

1. Create a new project with client details
2. Navigate to the **1. Document** tab
3. Upload all available source materials:
   - Company website content (copy/paste relevant pages)
   - Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
   - Process flowcharts and diagrams
   - Training documentation
   - Any public or provided information about the company
   - URLs for reference (note in description)

### Output

- Documents are parsed, chunked, and vectorized
- Content is stored in the project's knowledge base
- Document summaries are generated for analysis

---

## Step 2: Interview (Agent Analysis)

**Purpose:** AI agents analyze the uploaded source information to identify inefficiencies and create an interview script for the customer interview.

**Tab:** 2. Interview

### What Happens

The system runs automated analysis phases where agents process the source information:

**Phase 1 - Document Ingestion:**
- All uploaded documents are processed
- Content is analyzed for process patterns
- Information is prepared for hypothesis generation

**Phase 2 - Hypothesis Generation:**
- AI analyzes document content for operational inefficiencies
- Identifies suspected automation opportunities
- Generates confidence-scored hypotheses about:
  - "Dull" tasks (repetitive, boring work)
  - "Dirty" tasks (data manipulation, cleanup)
  - "Dangerous" tasks (error-prone, high-risk)

**Phase 3 - Interview Script Creation:**
- AI generates role-specific interview questions
- Questions target validation of hypotheses
- Follow-up questions are prepared for deeper exploration

### Actions

1. Navigate to the **2. Interview** tab
2. Click **Start Analysis**
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Review generated hypotheses
5. Proceed to Step 3 to view the interview script

### Output

- List of hypotheses with confidence scores
- Identified areas of potential inefficiency
- Interview script ready for use (view in Step 3)

---

## Step 3: Interview Script

**Purpose:** Provide the interview script to be used for the interview with the customer.

**Tab:** 3. Interview Script

### What Happens

This step displays the interview script generated by the AI agents in Step 2. The script is ready to be used for conducting interviews with the customer.

### Script Structure

The generated script includes:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Introduction** | How to open the interview |
| **Role-Specific Questions** | Targeted questions based on interviewee role |
| **Hypothesis Validation** | Questions to confirm or deny suspected inefficiencies |
| **Process Exploration** | Open-ended questions about daily work |
| **Follow-up Prompts** | Probing questions for deeper insights |
| **Closing** | How to wrap up the interview |

### Actions

1. Navigate to the **3. Interview Script** tab
2. Review the generated interview script
3. Download or copy the script for use
4. Identify appropriate interviewees based on suggested roles
5. Schedule and conduct interviews with the customer
6. Document the interview results (transcripts, notes, observations)

### Output

- Complete interview script in structured format
- Role recommendations for interviewees
- Questions mapped to hypotheses

### Next Step

After conducting the interviews, proceed to **Step 4: Results** to submit the interview transcripts and additional documents.

## Human Breakpoint: Conduct the Interview

**This is where the consultant conducts real interviews with the customer.**

### Interview Guidelines

**Preparation:**
- Download the generated script
- Schedule 30-60 minute sessions
- Prepare note-taking or recording tools

**During the Interview:**
- Follow the script structure
- Use follow-up questions when discovering insights
- Document specific examples and time estimates
- Note any process variations or workarounds

**Key Areas to Explore:**
- How work is **actually** done vs. documented
- Pain points and frustrations
- Unofficial workarounds
- Time spent on tasks
- Bottlenecks and delays

### Creating the Transcript

Document interview results in a structured format:

```
Interview Transcript
====================

Participant: [Role/Title]
Date: [Date]
Department: [Department]

Q: [Question from script]
A: [Interviewee's response]

Key Observations:
- [Notable insight 1]
- [Notable insight 2]
- [Time estimates mentioned]
- [Workarounds discovered]
```

---

## Step 4: Results

**Purpose:** Add interview results (transcripts and additional documents) and have agents create the analysis for the final report.

**Tab:** 4. Results

### What to Provide

This step allows you to add extra documents obtained during the interviews. Submit:
- Interview transcripts with responses to script questions
- Key observations and insights from conversations
- Specific examples and time estimates mentioned
- Pain points and workarounds discovered
- Any additional documents obtained during interviews

### What Happens

After submitting the interview results, AI agents will:

**Phase 4 - Gap Analysis:**
- Compare documented SOPs with interview findings
- Identify discrepancies between documentation and reality
- Classify gaps by automation potential

**Phase 5 - Solution Architecture:**
- Map identified gaps to potential solutions
- Generate technology recommendations
- Calculate ROI estimates
- Create prioritized implementation roadmap

### Actions

1. Navigate to the **4. Results** tab
2. Paste the interview transcript in the text area
3. Click **Submit and Generate Analysis**
4. Wait for gap analysis and solution generation to complete
5. Review the generated results

### Output

- **Gap Analysis:** Documented vs. actual process differences
- **Solution Recommendations:** Technology and approach suggestions
- **ROI Estimates:** Projected time and cost savings
- **Priority Matrix:** Implementation prioritization

### Next Step

Proceed to **Step 5: Report** to view and download the final deliverable.

---

## Step 5: Report

**Purpose:** Display the final report with all findings and recommendations for the customer.

**Tab:** 5. Report

### What Happens

**Phase 6 - Report Generation:**
- AI compiles all analysis into a professional report
- Creates executive summary with key metrics
- Organizes findings and recommendations
- Generates PDF deliverable

### Report Contents

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Executive Summary** | High-level findings and key recommendations |
